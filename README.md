üß† Fashion MNIST Image Classification (CNN)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize 10 different categories of clothing items.

üîç Project Highlights
Model: Developed a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.

Performance: Achieved 89%+ accuracy on the test set.

Dataset: Processed 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images (28√ó28).

Visualization: Plotted training and validation loss/accuracy curves to track model performance over 10 epochs.

Integration Ready: Modular design built with TensorFlow/Keras for easy reuse in other deep learning workflows.
